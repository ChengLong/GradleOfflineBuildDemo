Gradle Offline Build Demo
===

This app is to demo how to do offline build using Gradle. By `offline`, I mean:

* NO Internet connection
* NO Gradle installed
* NO local Maven repo

By using Gradle Wrapper and storing dependencies in local directories of the project, we can still build and manage dependencies using Gradle.

I wrote a detailed post [here](http://chengl.com/gradle-offline-build).
